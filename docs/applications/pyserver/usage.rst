Execution
==========

There are several examples that demonstrate how to serve custom content.
To try them, run one of the following commands from the ``microraiden``
directory:

.. code:: bash

    python3 -m microraiden.examples.demo_proxy --private-key <private_key_file> start

or

.. code:: bash

    python3 -m microraiden.examples.wikipaydia --private-key <private_key_file> --private-key-password-file <password_file> start


By default, the web server listens on ``0.0.0.0:5000``.
The private key file should be in the JSON format produced by Geth/Parity
(A guide how to extract private keys is described in the :ref:`Blockchain Tutorial <blockchain-setup>`)
and must be readable and writable only by the owner to be accepted (``-rw-------``).
Using unixoid operating systems, ``chmod a-rw`` filename followed by ``chmod u+rw`` filename
sets the correct permissions for the private key file.
A ``--private-key-password-file`` option can be specified, containing the password for the
private key in the first line of the file. If itâ€™s not provided, the password will be
prompted interactively in the command line options.
